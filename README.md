#Motives

I wanted to try out sockets and instant messaging, i got the idea to create a discord like app that lets users create servers and manage and join them to learn
and grasp the concept of sockets. You can join and create servers, message your friends, and kick users from servers if you're a server owner.

I think the next steps for this project is adding a private messaging between users, but that's for a later date, and track if a user is online.

But for the moment, on to the next.
